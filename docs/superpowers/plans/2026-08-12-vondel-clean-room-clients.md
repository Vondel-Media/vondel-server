# Vondel Clean-Room Native Clients Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build original, native Vondel clients for all Apple and Android targets with complete Watch, Listen and Read support, while retaining documented compatibility with Vondel and official Silo servers.

**Architecture:** A platform-neutral contracts repository defines server schemas, invented fixtures and conformance behavior. Empty Apple and Android repositories independently implement those contracts using SwiftUI/native Apple media frameworks and Kotlin/Compose/Media3; they share no UI or application runtime. TV is the first production-complete vertical slice, but submission is blocked until the full media/platform matrix passes.

**Tech Stack:** JSON Schema/OpenAPI, Go conformance runner, Swift 6/SwiftUI/AVFoundation/Core Media/XCTest/XcodeGen, Kotlin 2.1/Coroutines/Compose/Media3/Room/WorkManager/JUnit/Gradle, GitHub Actions.

## Global Constraints

- Create new private zero-parent repositories `Vondel-Media/vondel-client-contracts`, `Vondel-Media/vondel-apple`, and `Vondel-Media/vondel-android`.
- Never add either `silo-*-reference` repository as a remote, dependency, submodule, build input or source generator.
- No reference source, assets, layouts, internal symbols, tests, filenames or package structure may be copied.
- The only shared boundary is documented server contracts plus deterministic invented fixtures.
- Support movies, episodic television, music, audiobooks, ebooks and manga on iPhone, iPad, macOS, Apple TV, Android phone, Android tablet and Android TV before store submission.
- Implement both Vondel and capability-compatible official Silo server connections.
- Use `media.vondel.app` application identities and `media.vondel` source namespaces.
- Use AGPL-3.0-or-later and record every dependency/asset license.
- Keep repositories private and publication workflows disabled until the final acceptance task explicitly enables signed store delivery.
- Never claim store approval is guaranteed; build auditable evidence of original implementation and value.
- Client implementers do not inspect reference source. A separate audit role produces fingerprint/similarity reports after implementation and cannot contribute application code.

## Execution lanes

- Tasks 1–2 establish the mandatory provenance and contract boundary.
- Tasks 3 and 4 run in parallel after Task 2.
- Task 5 runs in parallel per platform after both foundations expose the same route semantics.
- Tasks 6–9 are vertical feature slices; Apple and Android implementations run in parallel within each slice, while Watch, Listen and Read coordinators remain isolated.
- Task 10 begins only after Tasks 6–9 are green on every target.

### Task 1: Create Empty Repositories and Originality Gates

**Files:**
- Create in each repository: `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `README.md`, `ORIGINALITY.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Create in contracts: `internal/originality/guard.go`, `internal/originality/guard_test.go`
- Create in clients: `scripts/verify-clean-room.sh`, `scripts/verify-clean-room_test.sh`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces `originality.Scan(root string, forbiddenRoot string) error` and the clean-room ledger format consumed by every later task.

- [ ] Write a failing Go test using an invented forbidden file named `SiloPlaybackCoordinator.swift` and copied canary text; require the guard to reject distinctive filenames, source fragments, binary-identical assets and forbidden remotes while accepting required protocol terms such as `/api/v1/`.

```go
func TestScanRejectsReferenceCanaries(t *testing.T) {
    err := originality.Scan(t.TempDir(), "/tmp/reference-fixture")
    if err == nil || !strings.Contains(err.Error(), "reference similarity") {
        t.Fatalf("Scan error = %v", err)
    }
}
```

- [ ] Run `go test ./internal/originality -run TestScanRejectsReferenceCanaries -count=1` and record the expected RED result before implementation.
- [ ] In an audit-only process, implement SHA-256 asset comparison, normalized nontrivial source-fragment comparison, distinctive-path comparison, Git remote rejection and a narrow standardized-protocol allowlist; emit reports without making reference source available to client implementers.
- [ ] Create the three Git repositories locally with only legal/provenance/guard files, verify GitHub targets are PRIVATE before first push, disable Actions publication, commit zero-parent roots and push.
- [ ] Run the originality guard against both reference repositories and require zero unexplained findings.

```bash
go test ./internal/originality -count=1
./scripts/verify-clean-room.sh ../silo-apple-reference
./scripts/verify-clean-room.sh ../silo-android-reference
```

### Task 2: Define the Server Contract and Disposable Conformance Harness

**Files:**
- Create contracts: `schema/openapi.yaml`, `schema/events/*.schema.json`, `schema/playback/*.schema.json`, `schema/offline/*.schema.json`
- Create contracts: `fixtures/{identity,auth,catalog,watch,listen,read,playback,offline,errors}/*.json`
- Create contracts: `cmd/vondel-client-conformance/main.go`, `internal/conformance/{client.go,suite.go,report.go}`
- Create server: `internal/clientcontract/export_test.go`, `internal/clientcontract/conformance_test.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces versioned schemas and `conformance.Run(ctx context.Context, baseURL string, fixtureSet fs.FS) (Report, error)`.

- [ ] Write failing schema tests for identity/capabilities, login/refresh/profile, catalog/search, six media types, progress, playback plan, WebSocket events and offline bundles using invented IDs such as movie `4242`, series `8080`, album `313`, audiobook `2718`, ebook `1618` and manga `5772`.
- [ ] Run `go test ./internal/conformance ./schema -count=1` and record RED failures for absent schemas.
- [ ] Write the schemas from Vondel Server route and API documentation, not client reference models; include required/optional fields, enum values and explicit forward-compatible unknown-field behavior.
- [ ] Implement a disposable-server runner that creates a unique database, migrates it, seeds invented media, starts Vondel on a loopback port, runs all contract cases, then validates and drops only the generated database.
- [ ] Add an official-Silo compatibility job that runs the same baseline contract subset against pinned Silo Server commit `1dcdd4b27ab5fcd697a32fc20f20c2400ca24688`.
- [ ] Commit/push contracts and server harness; require exact-head CI green in both repositories.

### Task 3: Establish Apple Targets, Identity and Connection Foundation

**Files:**
- Create Apple: `project.yml`, `Config/*.xcconfig`, `Sources/VondelCore/{Contract,Connection,Identity,Storage}/**`
- Create Apple: `Apps/{iOS,tvOS,macOS}/**`, `Tests/VondelCoreTests/**`, `UITests/**`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces `ServerGateway`, `CapabilitySet`, `AccountScope`, `SecureAccountVault` and scoped local-store protocols.

- [ ] Write XCTest RED cases proving server/account/profile changes yield different `AccountScope` values, stale responses cannot enter a new scope, token refresh is single-flight and credentials never enter diagnostics.

```swift
func testProfileSwitchRejectsPreviousScopeResult() async throws {
    let old = AccountScope(serverID: "one", accountID: "a", profileID: "p1")
    let new = AccountScope(serverID: "one", accountID: "a", profileID: "p2")
    XCTAssertFalse(new.accepts(ResponseEnvelope(scope: old, value: 42)))
}
```

- [ ] Create XcodeGen targets for iOS/iPadOS, tvOS and macOS using bundle IDs beneath `media.vondel.app`; generate the project and verify target/product identity without signing.
- [ ] Implement URL validation, capability probe, authentication/refresh, Keychain vault and scoped SQLite/SwiftData store from contracts fixtures.
- [ ] Create original platform-native connection/profile UI and accessibility identifiers; do not inspect reference screen structure.
- [ ] Run unit/UI tests and unsigned target builds, originality scan and dependency license audit; commit/push and require exact-head CI green.

- Create tests under each module's `src/test` and UI tests under `src/androidTest`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces Kotlin `ServerGateway`, `CapabilitySet`, `AccountScope`, `SecureAccountVault` and scoped Room database interfaces matching Task 3 semantics but not source layout.

- [ ] Write JUnit RED cases for scope isolation, stale-response rejection, single-flight refresh, encrypted credential persistence and diagnostic redaction.

```kotlin
@Test fun profileSwitchRejectsPreviousScopeResult() {
    val old = AccountScope("one", "a", "p1")
    val current = AccountScope("one", "a", "p2")
    assertFalse(current.accepts(ResponseEnvelope(old, 42)))
}
```

- [ ] Implement TV catalog/detail/focus flows first using original editorial composition, then implement phone/tablet/macOS variants from the Vondel design system.
- [ ] Implement independent Apple and Android playback coordinators that validate server plans and map them to AVFoundation/Core Media or Media3 routes.
- [ ] Run codec/container/subtitle/HDR/network-transition matrices against controlled media and assert no credentials or media URLs appear in logs.
